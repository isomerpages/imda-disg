The DISG team is made up of a diverse group of officers from EDB, EnterpriseSG and IMDA. Besides having their respective parent agenciesâ€™ missions and mandates in mind, the team comes together with a common passion for technology, and a heart for building a vibrant ecosystem of local and global enterprises in Singapore.<br>

On a day -to-day basis, the team is usually on the move, be it meeting industry partners or tech companies to understand their capabilities, challenges, and growth aspirations, and working with them on targeted programmes and initiatives to support their growth. The team also catches up regularly with counterparts from other government agencies and organisations to identify areas of collaboration and explore synergies to better support the tech sector. The team also gathers insights from the ground that could be of use for the shaping of future government initiatives and programmes.<br>

At the end of the day, the DISG team always makes time to gather back at their shared office space, which allows the team with varying backgrounds, expertise, and experiences to come together to learn from each other and collaborate more effectively.
