<h3><strong>Accelerate Your AI Ambitions from Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>Singapore is where AI innovation meets real-world application—and where
global companies come to build, scale, and lead.</p>
<p>The government partners with industry leaders to drive AI excellence through
two key pathways:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Establishing <strong>AI Centers of Excellence (CoEs)</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launching <strong>Industry-Academia AI Labs</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these platforms help companies turn cutting-edge research into
enterprise-grade solutions, while tapping into Singapore’s rich ecosystem
of talent, infrastructure, and trusted governance.</p>
<h3><strong>AI Centers of Excellence</strong></h3>
<p>EDB aims to work with over 100 global and regional corporates to set up
AI Centers of Excellence that anchor advanced AI capabilities in Singapore.
These CoEs span industries—from manufacturing and logistics to finance,
healthcare, and tech—and serve as hubs for AI research, development, and
deployment</p>
