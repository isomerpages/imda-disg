<p>No, please submit a single application with your main use case. Should
the application be approved, your assigned CSP and partner will be happy
to discuss the different use cases you have in mind and advise on a prioritisation
framework and implementation roadmap as needed.</p>
<p></p>

<p>No, you will need to work with a pre-qualified Consulting Partner on the
ECI list. These SIs are selected based on their familiarity with the CSPs’
cloud credits and tools. If your application is approved, your assigned
CSP will get in touch with onboarding information including your assigned
partner.</p>
