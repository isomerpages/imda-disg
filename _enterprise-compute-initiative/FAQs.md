<p>Companies may apply for ECI through <a href="https://www.disg.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Industry Singapore</a>. The launch
dates of each cohort will be announced by DISG and the respective CSPs
from Q2 2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What is the processing time for applications? What milestones can I expect after application?</strong>
</p>
<p>Applicants will be notified on the status of their application within
4 weeks. Successful applicants will also be notified of their assigned
CSP, which will subsequently reach out with onboarding information, including
programme milestones.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Is it mandatory to select a CSP that I am currently using?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, it is not mandatory. You may select a CSP that you are not currently
using.</p>
<p></p>

</p>
<p>No. This is not allowed. We encourage the parent entity to join the programme

<p></p>
<p><strong>My company has multiple use cases. Do I need to submit multiple applications?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, please submit a single application with your main use case. Should
the application be approved, your assigned CSP and partner will be happy
to discuss the different use cases you have in mind and advise on a prioritisation
framework and implementation roadmap as needed.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>My application was rejected previously. Can I try again?</strong>
</p>
<p>Unsuccessful applicants are welcome to apply again with a revised or new
project proposal. However, applicants should ensure that there have been
meaningful modifications since the prior submission.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>I have a preferred consulting partner/SI which is not on the list of partners. Can I still work with them?</strong>
</p>
<p>No, you will need to work with a pre-qualified Consulting Partner on the
ECI list. These SIs are selected based on their familiarity with the CSPs’
cloud credits and tools. If your application is approved, your assigned
CSP will get in touch with onboarding information including your assigned
partner.</p>
