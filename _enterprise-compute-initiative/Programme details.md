<p><strong>Ready to harness AI for your organisation? </strong>At Budget
2025, MOF announced that it has set aside up to $150 million for the Enterprise
Compute Initiative (ECI). The ECI is designed to support Singapore-based
companies with their AI transformation projects by making available (i)
cloud credits and related tools and (ii) consultancy services to develop
a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and change management. The ECI is a short-term
programme meant to catalyse the value creation of AI across the economy.
It contributes to the broader goal stated in the National AI Strategy 2.0
of anchoring AI teams across Singapore.</p>
<p>The programme will run from FY2025 to 2026, with multiple cohorts launched
by various CSPs on a rolling basis. Done well, participating companies
will be well-placed to grow AI teams within their organisations.&nbsp;</p>
