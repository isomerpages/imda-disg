<h1><strong>Enterprise Compute Initiative</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>From AI ambition to action</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Ready to harness AI for your organisation? </strong>At Budget
2025, the Ministry of Finance announced that it has set aside up to $150
million for the Enterprise Compute Initiative (ECI). The ECI is designed
to support Singapore-based companies with their AI transformation projects
by making available (i) cloud credits and related tools and (ii) consultancy
services to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and change management.
The ECI is a short-term programme meant to catalyse the value creation
of AI across the economy. It contributes to the broader goal stated in
the National AI Strategy 2.0 of anchoring AI teams across Singapore.</p>
<p>The programme will run for one year from the respective launch dates of
each CSP, with multiple cohorts being deployed by different CSPs on a staggered
timeline. Done well, these companies may secure the mandate to establish
a dedicated AI team in Singapore.</p>
