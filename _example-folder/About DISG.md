Digital Industry Singapore (DISG) is a joint office of the Economic Development Board (EDB), Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) and Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). 

As a joint office, DISG drives the growth of the technology sector in the country by being a single interface for the Singapore government with industry, which enables us to better understand companies' needs.   

[HOW WE DO IT] 
DISG draws on the strengths of EDB, EnterpriseSG and IMDA to attract and foster globally competitive technology companies to create new products and services from Singapore, anchor global technology leaders, build local champions, and nurture future ready talent in Singapore, for Asia and beyond.


We do this by leveraging complementary networks, resources, and programs across agencies to help tech companies on their journeys. This includes supporting and partnering with companies in areas such as talent development, market access, and product innovation. 

[OUR MISSION] 
Our mission is to establish Singapore as a global-Asia technology hub with deep capabilities, strong infrastructure, and a vibrant ecosystem of local and global enterprises, making it easy for technology companies and talent to grow and thrive with Singapore.
