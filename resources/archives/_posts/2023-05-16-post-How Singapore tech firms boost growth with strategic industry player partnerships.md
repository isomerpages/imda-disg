## From local to global: How S'pore tech firms boost growth with strategic industry-player partnerships

<br>Robo-advisor platform Bambu and live streaming solution provider BeLive leverage collaborations with the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft to gain new leads and speed up their go-to-market process.

<br>Digital services are more interconnected than ever before. With the touch of a button in a mobile app, one can make online purchases, pay bills, and even send “e-angbaos” to loved ones. 

<br><br>While many such online transactions seem simple to the average consumer, beneath the surface is a complex network of interconnected systems working together to make them happen seamlessly.

<br><br>Similar to how it is key for these systems to work closely together, businesses are also forming strategic partnerships to develop better product offerings and access more business opportunities. Some work with companies that complement their capabilities, while others partner businesses with networks they may not typically have access to. 

<br><br>Recognising the value of collaboration and creating synergy, local firms such as Bambu and BeLive tapped on the support from Digital Industry Singapore (DISG) – a joint office of the government set up to drive the growth of the tech sector – to form strategic partnerships with other businesses in the ecosystem.

<br><br>**Offering reliable robo-advisor services backed by established cloud platforms**

<br><br>The advent of robo-advisors has made it simpler to invest passively, with customisable portfolios tailored to one’s risk appetite and automated rebalancing to respond to changes in the market. 

<br><br>While many robo-advisory platforms are positioned as alternatives to traditional wealth management services, established players like banks are increasingly looking to offer robo- advisors as an option for their customers.

<br><br>However, building such a service from scratch requires a significant investment of time and money, says Mr Ned Phillips, founder and CEO of Singapore-based wealth-tech service provider Bambu. 

<br><br>“If you want to build your own robo-advisor, you will need to set aside $20 million to $40 million, hire a team of 50 to 80 people, and have a marketing budget of $10 million to $15 million a year,” he says.

<br><br>This is why several major financial institutions like Standard Chartered, Principal Asset Management and Franklin Templeton adopted a partnership approach, choosing to work with Bambu – a company that had the expertise to build robo-advisors and develop the product offering in a more cost-effective manner.

<br><br>Mr Phillips notes that coming up with the investment algorithm is just one aspect of building a robo-adviser. The “real challenge” lies in integrating the platform with other existing software like core banking systems, customer relationship management systems and payment providers, and ensuring all the systems work seamlessly with each other.

<br><br>Following discussions with DISG, Bambu learnt that it would also benefit from partnering closely and strategically with a cloud service provider like AWS, to ensure service reliability and security of its robo-advisors. 

<br><br>While Bambu had been a customer of AWS since it was founded in 2016, the company formed a strategic partnership with AWS and joined the AWS Partner Network in 2021. Under the partnership, Bambu works closely with AWS to “co-build, co-sell and co-market” its services, says Mr Phillips.

<br><br>Besides ensuring that Bambu’s robo-advisors work smoothly on the cloud, the partnership also gives Bambu the opportunity to showcase its tech capabilities to other companies on the AWS Partner Network, and potentially engage them as new customers.

<br><br>In the case of the partnership between Bambu and AWS, DISG also discussed with AWS on assigning Bambu a dedicated partnerships lead – an AWS staff member who helps ensure the partnership process goes smoothly – when the Singapore firm joined the AWS Partner Network. 

<br><br>Such engagements by DISG with digital carriers like cloud service providers are part of this joint office’s efforts to help local tech firms build strong channels and partnerships within the wider ecosystem, which allows companies like Bambu to expand their reach and serve the current customers. 

<br><br>Mr Phillips says: “Utilising a partnership lead from AWS helped us in the early growth stages of our deployment to the Cloud. Our API (application programme interface) Library required certain cloud technologies to support our high-frequency digital wealth products. We also needed to keep our costs to a minimum. The knowledge provided to us by the partnerships lead helped Bambu scale up and scale down the AWS infrastructure efficiently. From this, we only paid for the services we needed in real-time."
